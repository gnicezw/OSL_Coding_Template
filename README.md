activity?

## Introduction
Please provide a narrative of what the unit is about, and why we should learn
that is simple enough for a student to read and understand. For example: "In
this workshop, we will be using ... to explore ... so that you have a better
understanding of how ..."

## Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
What age range is this exercise designed for and what do students and
teachers need to know to be able to be successful in the workshop? Are there
any tools/toolkits they should already be comfortable with, any frameworks or
tools they should have installed before class?

## Outcomes & Goals
This can be easily answered by completing these example sentences:
* In this workshop, we will be... (writing, planning, soldering, setting up an
RPi home network, and making a wearable that communicates with....)
* Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of...
* Students will contemplate the ethical use of technology in terms of
social justice and inclusion.

## Materials
What prototyping tools will students or teachers need for lessons? This could
be anything from 3d printing designs to cardboard to Arduinos (we encourage
you to be as expansive and creative as possible.)

### Exercises To Do Before Class

# Week 4
## Design for Diversity and Design for all the Senses / Thomas Tajo

### Design for Diversity
* In this workshop students are introduced the new philosophy of design "Design for Diversity." I will introduce the theory of Bioplasticity which is behind the new philosophy of design "Design for Diversity." 
* A concept taken from evolutionary biology, epigenetics, and neuroscience. Latest scientific understanding which tells that capacities of living biology to be open and plastic. It is this plasticity of living biology is what gives rise to living beings with diverse forms and functional abilities.
* The concept of Bioplasticity tells us always to expect diversity. It tellls us that diversity is the
norm and not the exception. Hence, if we live in a world inhabited by living beings with diverse forms and functional abilities
then it is vital that we acknowledge and embrace the reality that is diversity.

### How do we do this in design?
* Living in a world peopled with diverse forms and functional abilities, it is essential that our
design philosophy reflect the reality that is diversity. Our products and services have to meet the needs of diverse human forms and functional
abilities. That is how we will acknowledge diversity and design for diversity, delivering justice with our
designs and achieve social inclusion with our products and services.

### Materials
Students would be asked to research the concept of diversity and read this text before coming to the class.

* First 20 minutes of the class would be used for introduction and to ponder if they fall into any category of diversity and defining the concept of diversity as
an ice-breaker.
* Next 15 minutes would be used to introduce the concept of Bioplasticity and to explain the philosophy of Design for Diversity
* Following 20 minutes would be used to discuss the idea with the students
* Then the students would be asked to pick an existing product/service to evaluate with the new
philosophy of Design for Diversity or they would be asked to imagine a new product/service to apply the new philosophy of Design for Diversity to their designs

### Design for all the Senses
*  In this workshop students are introduced to the design philosophy "Design for all the Senses." They will be introduced to the idea that human beings have more than 5 traditional senses. They will be taught to acknowledge the diversity of senses and sensory abilities we have. To insert access to multiple senses in product-design from inception.
*  To do away with the problem of accessibility that is artificially created by failing to include multisensory access to products and services from inception.
*  They would be introduced to the benefits of multisensory designs [products accessible to multiple senses]. How multisensory designs meet the changing needs of people across life-time and give people the freedom to fluidly shift access products and services from one sensory modality to another. Preventing over sensory stimulation and sensory deprivation Supporting the balanced use and development of diversity of senses we possess.

*  First 20 minutes would be used for introduction and to ask them to think about how many senses they have and employ in daily tasks, as an ice-breaker.
*  Next 15 minutes would be used to introduce the idea that we have more than 5 senses. To discuss different senses, starting with the five traditional senses we know. How we can move towards designing products and services accessible to multiple senses from inception. To explain the philosophy of multisensory design or Design for all the Senses.
*  The following 20 minutes would be used to discuss the idea with the students. Then the students would be asked to pick an existing product/service to evaluate with the new philosophy of multisensory design or Design for all the Senses or they would be asked to imagine a new product/service to apply the new philosophy of
Multisensory Design to their product/service.

### Wednesday Excursion
Students will be asked to evaluate the space they visit on the Wednesday excursion. Applying the philosophies of Design for Diversity and Design for all the Senses to rethink how these public spaces can be redesigned to meet the criteria of designing for diversity of human forms and abilities that we know to inhabit the planet.

# Week 5

## Workshop Title: Developing Socially Responsible Computing Practices and Speculative Ethical Fiction

## Name: Dr. Joslenne Peña

### Tuesday, August 9th @ 10:20am-11:45am EST

## Description: 
Students will explore the dimensions of socially responsible computing practices when designing and developing software. Students will gain an understanding of how certain design decisions create harm for vulnerable populations through speculative and ethical design. As such, students will unpack important definitions, look at different examples of current practices, engage in group discussions, and work on an artifact.

## Timeline: 
Getting to Know Folks! / My Introduction (5min)
Introduction to Socially Responsible Concepts - Unpack Definitions and Terms (15min)
Talking about Black Mirror and Speculative Ethical Design (15min)

## Activity Steps:
* STEP 1: Individual Brainstorming. (5 minutes) Individually, write down ideas related to the topic, especially: (1) current events and news items that seem relevant (can provide links!); (2) things that currently worry you; and (3) where you think this issue might be headed in the future.

* STEP 2: Group Discussion. (10 minutes) Discuss the individual ideas that each of you had. Settle on an overarching topic/idea for inspiration for a cautionary tale. If you haven’t already, do a quick news search to find some relevant headlines (or whatever you like!) to include on the inspiration slide. Alternately you can just put text on the slide about the kinds of things that are inspiring you.

* STEP 3: Come up with a story. (10 minutes) Think about the thing you want to create a cautionary tale about. What fictional person in the future could help illustrate this caution? What is their story?  

* STEP 4: Create your episode pitch. (10 minutes) Come up with a title, and condense your story into 50-100 word blurb, similar to the examples you saw. It’s fine to give away the ending! Also find an image that illustrates it. I’ve provided some links to where you can find free-to-use photos but you can use whatever you like. Make a slide!

* STEP 5: Report back! Choose one member of your group to share your pitch with the rest of the class in about one minute.
Debrief / Reflection (5 min)
